	Makefile:
        	- Command 'make' compiles the .c source files using the gcc compiler. 
        	- Command 'make clean' will clean all auxiliary files.
        	- Command 'make all' will call 'make clean' followed by 'make'.
        	- Command 'make test' and 'make fulltest' will compile and execute with valgrind.
        	- Command 'make binTest' will create a binary called binTest.
        	
	shell.c:
		- The main program - will be compiled into an executable named shell_sh.
		- Records history by keeping a static pointer to (char *). Each history entry is 
		  allocated memory on heap and deallocated only upon shell termination. Indivual 
		  calls to child processes to not remove these entries. Only upon either reaching 
		  the maximum history size is or shell termination is the history entry deallocated.
		  History follows a circular buffer structure and uses mod arithmetic to determine
		  the correct index for next history entry insertion.
		- Commands for changing directories and exiting are implemented.
		- Future update will include commands for handling pipes and more bug testing.

	shell.h:
		- The header file containing the documentation and prototypes of the shell.c 
		  functions.

	binTest.c:
		- Used to test if the shell can execute a binary file.

How to run the shell:
